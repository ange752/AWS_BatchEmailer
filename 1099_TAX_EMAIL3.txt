Hi there!,

Hope you're doing great! This is our final reminder that if your earnings have crossed the $600 mark (yay you!), then you need to make sure your account info is up-to-date by January 15th. Here's a quick way to do it:

1. Log into your Spring account.
2. Click Settings.
3. Take a peek at your personal info and tweak it if needed.

For faster access, click on this link: https://teespring.com/dashboard/settings

We'll be sending you your 1099 form by January 31st. It's important for your tax records, so keep an eye out for that!

If you need any help or have questions, just shout out – we're always here to help.

Best regards,
The Spring Team
