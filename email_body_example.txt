Hello,

This is a plain text email example. You can format it however you like.

Here are some formatting tips:
- Use blank lines to separate paragraphs
- Use dashes or asterisks for bullet points
- Keep lines to about 72-80 characters for better readability
- Use ALL CAPS sparingly (it looks like shouting)

Best regards,
Your Name
