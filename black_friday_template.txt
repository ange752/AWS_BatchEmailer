Hi!

I wanted to reach out personally because you've been one of our most consistent sellers on our Spring platform. With Black Friday/Cyber Monday coming up, we want to help you get the most out of the weekend.

We're running a 15% off sale from 11/28–12/1 with the code BLACKFRIDAY15, and we'd love to support you by running ads for you on Meta and/or YouTube — completely on us.

If you'd like us to promote your products for Black Friday, all you need to do is reply with your Meta or YouTube handle.

Once we have that, we'll send over a quick invite so we can run ads using your content.

To prep for the sale, here's what will help the most:

• Post content promoting your products + the sale (we can boost these posts for you)

• Add new products or fresh designs so your fans have something new to shop

If you want help with ads this weekend, just send back your handle and we'll get everything set up for you.

Excited to support you and help drive more sales,

Amelia Betancourt
Director of Brand Marketing
