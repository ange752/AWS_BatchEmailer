Greetings,

We wanted to let you know that Amaze Studio will be shutting down on December 15, 2025. After this date, you'll no longer be able to access Amaze Studio or its online features.

To help you keep your projects live, we've prepared step-by-step guides with everything you need to download and self-host your Amaze Studio projects before the shutdown date:

- How to Download Project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K2a6YX63UKgGwtCpBUIHGySUs1eWFTXz/view?usp=sharing
- How to Self Host Your Project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JiiLIo_AduW27EkzBdA8nlhzqtgy6F7F/view?usp=sharing

Please be sure to download your projects and follow the hosting steps before December 15 to ensure your sites remain available after Amaze Studio is retired.

We're so grateful to everyone who's used Amaze Studio to bring their ideas to life. Your creativity has inspired us, and we can't wait to share what's next at amaze.co.

— The Amaze Team
